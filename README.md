This will help you get started with Tapglue on iOS by showing a complete app.

A more detailed documentation can be found on our [documentation](http://developers.tapglue.com/docs/ios) website.

## Installing the SDK with CocoaPods

The easiest way to install Tapglue into your iOS project is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/).

1. Install CocoaPods with `gem install cocoapods`
2. Run `pod setup` to create a local CocoaPods spec mirror, if this is the first time using CocoaPods.
3. Run `pod install` in your project directory and Tapglue will be downloaded and installed (we've created the Podfile).
4. Restart your Xcode project

Thats it! Build the project try out our app.
